# Game Hub
 This is for my school project.

    The home page should:
Be responsive across screen sizes
Use neat and semantic HTML
Have CSS that follows the DRY principle


    Level 1 Process
Create the HTML for your home page. Use HTML5 elements where appropriate and remember to write unique titles and meta descriptions for the page, as well as ensure your pages are WCAG compliant.
Create a CSS file which is linked to your home page.
Consider how your page will look across various screen sizes (eg. Single column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens).
Write your CSS following the DRY principle.
Ensure youâ€™re making regular commits to your repository. You must use the repository you created on GitHub Classroom in Web and Communications Technology. Remember, you can view the files locally on your computer before your push changes to your repository.
Submit a link to the deployed site on Netlify.
